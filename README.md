This machine learning project is carried out perfoming a prediction using the logistic regression method, The prediction determines if a customer will be satisftied with the service of an airline company due to various factors that influence the decision of the customer. 

Skills and Tools used: Python for Exploratory Data Analysis (Variable Identification, Univariate analysis, Bi-Variate analysis), Jupyter Notebook and Excel.

Data Dictionary: The column data listed are used for the independent and dependent variables in the logistic regression algorithm which is used to generate the final output of the algorithm. 

Dependent Variable
- Satisfaction: The satisfaction index of the customer, in the algorithm 0 equates to dissatisfied, 1 equates to satisfied.

Independent Variable 
- Seat comfort : How the comfortable the seats are inside the airplane.
- On-board service : The good or inefficient the services are from the airline host/hostess.
